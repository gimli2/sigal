roadmap of sigal project
========================
- fix: hierarchy is not respected by mass download (take care of locked items)
- fix: hierarchy albums dont show thumbnails until they are generated in lower level
- fix: hierarchy - subalbums are shown as images, not albums
- link to upper directory like in commander (..) - fake first item
- Image watermarking (Overlay? - I dont want to manipulate original image)
- EXIF auto rotation (Only for thumbnails and preview? - I dont want to manipulate original image)
- photowall like http://quick.gallery/demo3/
